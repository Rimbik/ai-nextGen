**Image Caption Identifier**
----------------------------
This sample code is taken and coded using on of the class available in learning portal.
The model can predict Caption of an image (as can be seen in .ipynb file)

**Pre-Requisite**
You can execute the sample code in your machine, howver the traing will require days to complete.
If you use Google - Colab T4GPU / v2-8 TPU or any faster NPU - the training time can be reduced.
In this example attached, the training is not compted fully as it is taking 10hrs+ under V2-8 TPU
[This looks like absolutely impossible to train the model at home computer]

The idea is, when the traning is completed 
     - Save the model
     - utilize the model to guess "image caption"

This is a functional code!
