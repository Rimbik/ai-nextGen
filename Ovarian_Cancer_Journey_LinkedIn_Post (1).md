# How My Mother’s Cancer Diagnosis Was Missed — And What I Learned the Hard Way

I usually don’t share personal stories here, but this experience needs to be heard. If it can prevent even one delayed diagnosis, it’s worth sharing.

## 📅 The Beginning – March
My 70-year-old mother started experiencing increasing abdominal pain and severe constipation — bowel movement once every 30+ hours. She has a 10-year history of constipation, but this time, even Ayurvedic remedies (like Kabzhar, Kaimchurna) triggered intense pain.  

I sensed something was off.

Without waiting for a doctor, I took her for a **whole abdomen ultrasound (USG)**. It revealed a **4 cm cyst in the left ovary**.

## 🏥 The Medical Maze
What followed was a frustrating and disheartening journey through the healthcare system:

- **My family doctor** (10+ years treating her) dismissed the cyst as "normal in women".
- **A local chemist** said the same — “these are common and usually resolve.”
- She was given **digestive and bowel medications**.
- A **general physician, MD** advised us to consult a gastroenterologist — again, nothing definitive.
- A **surgeon finally flagged the cyst** and suggested visiting a gynecologist.
- The gynecologist **initially refused to engage**, saying it’s not her domain. Only after persistent questioning did she reluctantly order a **CT Scan and CA-125 test**.

By the time results came back, **90 days had passed** since the first USG.  
Diagnosis: **Ovarian Cancer, likely Stage 3**, already spread to both ovaries, the **sigmoid colon**, and possibly beyond.  
CA-125 levels were over 400.
:CT SAYS: retroperitomial
:Biopsy says: adenocarcinoma

## 🧠 Key Reflection
If **just one doctor** had suggested a **CA-125 blood test** early (₹400–₹500), or taken the USG cyst seriously, we might have caught this 90 days sooner — before it had spread.  
I wonder: What if I hadn’t done the USG on my own?

## 💡 Lessons I Learned (The Hard Way)
1. **Be proactive with diagnostics** – Don’t wait for referrals. Trust your instincts.
2. **A ₹500 CA-125 test** could save lives – self go for it if you see any ovarian cysts or unexplained abdominal symptoms. a normal range is 0-50 for CA-125, uf you see 100 or 400 or something immediately consult dr or sekf go for CT Scan
3. **Don’t settle for a single opinion.** Healthcare is not infallible. Seek multiple perspectives.
4. **Persistent bowel issues in elderly women deserve deep investigation** – not assumptions.
5. **CT Scans and USGs can be done without a doctor’s prescription.** If needed, take that step yourself.

## 🙏 What’s Next
We are now at **Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai**, undergoing treatment under a world-class oncology team.  
It’s still uncertain how my mother’s body will respond to chemotherapy at this age, but we are doing everything possible.

## 🗣️ Final Thoughts
I live in a well-connected city. I have access to excellent hospitals and specialists. I have health insurance. And yet — we lost 90 critical days because of **systemic inertia, assumptions, and rushed consultations.**

If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.

Please:
- Be aware.
- Ask questions.
- Don’t ignore your gut feeling.

Let’s build a culture where **listening to the patient** becomes as important as treating the patient.
