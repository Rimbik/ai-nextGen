1: Linear Regression
2: Polynomial Regression
3: Ridge Regression 
        (also known as Regularization)
        Advantages:
                - Reduce overfit problem
                - decreases multcoloniarity
                - minimizes variance of the model without increasing bias
                - Involves loss function using (RSS): RSS = Diff between actual and predicted values


4: Lasso Regression
         Advantages:
                Performs same as Ridge Regression but with diff algo
                mostly Used in healthcare industry
                
      
        
    Key Differences:
    Polynomian Regression vs Lasso/Ridge Regression
    ------------------------------------------------

    Model Type:
        Polynomial Regression fits a polynomial function (non-linear) to the data.
        Lasso Regression is a linear regression model with regularization to prevent overfitting.

    Regularization:
        Polynomial Regression does not include regularization by default, so it can easily overfit if the degree of the polynomial is too high.
        Lasso Regression includes L1 regularization to penalize large coefficients, which can result in feature selection and reduced model complexity.

    Use Cases:
        Polynomial Regression is useful when the data has a non-linear relationship with the target variable.
        Lasso Regression is useful when you need to regularize a linear model to prevent overfitting and perform feature selection.

    Interpretability:
        Polynomial Regression may be more difficult to interpret if the degree of the polynomial is high.
        Lasso Regression tends to result in sparse solutions, which can make the model more interpretable by zeroing out irrelevant features.

Conclusion:

If your data shows a non-linear relationship, polynomial regression can be a good choice. 
However, if you have many features and want to avoid overfitting or reduce the number of features, Lasso regression would be more appropriate.
